Right now, in 2023, we are at a phenomenally powerful pivot point in human civilization.
Thanks to progress made over the last 100 years, we now have the tools to construct reliable, efficient computation of unbounded sophistication.
Moreover, Haskellers are prepared better than most to participate in this coming revolution and even help initiate it.
As with the Scientific Revolution begun by Galileo and others in the 17th century, the correct computing revolution elevates us from guessing to knowing.
